Requirements:
PHP5 (has not been tested with PHP4, but it should work)
Smarty Template Engine
A modern web browser - Internet Explorer 6 is _NOT_ supported
Highly Recommended:
XCache (will work without it, but will be noticeably slower if there are many packs.) 
PHP CURL extension - without CURL, packlists served by dinoex's built in http server will not be downloaded correctly.
Normal txt files on a proper webserver (apache, lighty, nginx, etc) and local txt files will still be fine.

See your host for questions regarding the requirements.


Instructions: 

make sure templates_c and cache are chmoded to 777
edit admin.php and change the user and password!
visit admin.php to add and delete bots.
access URIs can be http, https, ftp, or a file path.
examples:
http://yoursite.com/packlist.txt
ftp://user:pass@yoursite.com/packlist.txt
/home/xdcc/bot/packlist.txt

to show only group specific packs, add a group filter in admin.php.
please do not include opening and closing tags (e.g. [,]).
example: onegroupnamehere
multiple groups example: (groupnameone|groupnametwo|groupnamethree)
WRONG: [durhuricanread]

bookmarks:
bookmarks can be added in the admin panel

various other settings such as skin and irc channel can be found in core.php
